# ATmega328P Sleep / Power Management
# SMCR at DATA 0x53 (I/O 0x33 -- in range for IN/OUT and SBI/CBI)
#
# SMCR bits:
#   bit 3: SM2 \
#   bit 2: SM1  > Sleep Mode select
#   bit 1: SM0 /
#   bit 0: SE   -- Sleep Enable
#
# Sleep modes (SM[2:0]):
#   000 = Idle              -- CPU halted; peripherals (UART, SPI, timers) running; ~6 mA
#   001 = ADC Noise         -- as Idle but ADC, timers, ext-int wake; best ADC accuracy
#   010 = Power-down        -- only ext-int, WDT, TWI address match wake; ~0.1 uA
#   011 = Power-save        -- Power-down but Timer2 (async) keeps running
#   110 = Standby           -- Power-down + fast 6-cycle wake (osc already running)
#   111 = Extended Standby  -- Power-save + fast wake
#
# To enter sleep: set SMCR = (mode << 1) | SE=1, then execute SLEEP instruction.
# To exit sleep: MCU wakes on interrupt, resumes after SLEEP.
# Best practice: clear SE after waking to prevent accidental re-entry.
#
# SMCR I/O address = 0x33. SBI/CBI range is 0x00-0x1F so we use OUT.
